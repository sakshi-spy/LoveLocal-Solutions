Question :---
Easy 1
Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.
A word is a maximal 
substring consisting of non-space characters only.

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.
There will be at least one word in s.

Sample input and outputs:
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.

Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.

Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.

Solution:

import java.util.*;
public class LengthOfLastWord {
    public static int lengthOfLastWord(String s) {
        s = s.trim();
        int lastSpaceIndex = s.lastIndexOf(' ');
        return s.length() - lastSpaceIndex - 1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        String input = sc.nextLine();
        int result = lengthOfLastWord(input);
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}

Explanation:

***import java.util.*** : This is a Java import statement. It is used to make all the classes and interfaces of the java.util package available in the current Java source file.
                          In our Program we used this for Scanner Class.

***lengthOfLastWord(String s)*** : The method public static int lengthOfLastWord(String s) is a Java method that calculates and returns the length of the last word in a given string s.
                                  s.trim(): This trims any leading or trailing spaces from the input string.
                                  s.lastIndexOf(' '): This finds the last index of the space character in the trimmed string. This index is the position of the last space before the last word.
                                  s.length() - lastSpaceIndex - 1: This calculates the length of the last word by taking the difference between the length of the trimmed string and the index of the last space,
                                                                   and then subtracting 1. The subtraction of 1 is necessary because the indices in Java are zero-based.


***public static void main(String[] args)*** : This is the main Method in which inputs will be taken and output will be printed.
                                             Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);: This line creates a Scanner object named sc, which is used to read input from the console. 
                                                        System.in represents the standard input stream (console input).
                                             String input = sc.nextLine();: This line reads a line of text from the console using the Scanner object sc and stores it in a String variable named input. 
                                                                            This line is waiting for the user to input a line of text and press Enter.
                                             int result = lengthOfLastWord(input);: This line calls a method named lengthOfLastWord and passes the user input (input variable) as an argument. 
                                                                                    The result of this method call (the length of the last word) is stored in an int variable named result.
                                             System.out.println(result);: This line prints the value of the result variable to the console using System.out.println. 
                                                                          It displays the length of the last word that was calculated in the previous step.
